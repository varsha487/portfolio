# portfolio
for UPE

To open my portfolio on your local machine, click the green "code" button and then "download zip" at the bottom. Unzip the folder, and then open the folder with VSCode (or any text editor). Make sure you have the extension "Live Server" installed in VSCode. Right-click on the index.html file. Click "open with live server". This should open the portfolio in your browser.

My video demo was too large to upload, so here's the link to it: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14-yhuBQ32V9KEoD5ZfoCpRstTrIgGXDQ/view?usp=sharing
